# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.
I used the following methods for the analysis:

  * preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
  * compile, train and evaluate the model,
  * optimize the model.
